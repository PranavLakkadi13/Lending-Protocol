# Core Concept:
    -> 2 differnet chains (Dojima & Hermes), Dojima is the L1 EVM compatible and Hermes is Used for the communication with different chains 



# Core DApp Logic Or MindMap




# Questions:
1) Is Dojima completely independent of Hermes? or does heremes manage the validators of dojima as well? ✅
2) Hermes is like the communication layer and the main middleware where the interchain funds are stored and managed? ✅



# Missing links or issues in docs or networks:
1) The link to the contract state Sender in the dojima network/contracts/InboundStateSender/ link isnt working 
2) need more clarity on the liquidity part of the dojima like is it
